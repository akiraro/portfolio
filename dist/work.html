            <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>
              Smart Walking Stick is a final year capstone project for Computer
              Engineering student in University of Ottawa. The idea came when I
              realized the difficulties faced by impaired vision people in their
              daily life when they only depend on the old single featured of
              walking stick. I was thinking that the walking stick can be
              improvise by adding some latest technology features to improved
              the user experience and aid the impaired vision people. Along with
              3 other teammates who agreed with this idea as a Capstone project,
              we worked on this project for a year.
            </h3>

            <h2>Technical</h2>
            <h3>
              Some main features that was implemented on the walking stick such
              as SOS Emergency notifier, obstacles detector and Indoor
              Navigation System (INS). As we knew, Global Positioning System
              (GPS) does not work inside building which caused any navigation
              application such as Google Maps, Apple Maps and etc will not work
              inside building. Thus, we decided to implement our own INS using
              RFID technology and some algorithm.
            </h3>

            <h2>What I did</h2>
            <h3>
              I was responsible for back-end and front-end development. For the
              back-end, I setup, managed and monitor AWS for the API request. I
              wrote API using NodeJS for best route finding API and also
              implemented Djikstra's Algorithm to improve the efficiency for the
              computation
            </h3>
            <h3>
              For the front-end, my teammates and I developed an Android
              application for the user and implemented a voice recognition
              feature where it allows the user to use the application by giving
              out command with just one tap

              that developed a mobile application for advance mobile food
              ordering and restaurant's Point of Sale system. I am one of the
              co-founders of Virqueue along with three other co-founders who are
              also my friends. The idea was came when we realized there is no
              advance food ordering system in Malaysia and we would like to
              facilitate workers in Malaysia who got a limited lunch hours.
              Unfortunately, the start-up company did not make through since we
              are not able to find investors and all other co-founders decided
              to back off.

              database (Firebase) to store all the live data. For the push
              notification, I also used Firebase to store the data and used the

              Machine Learning: Titanic Disaster is a end of semester coursework
              project for Artificial Intelligence course in University of
              Ottawa. We chose this idea as there was a competition on Kaggle to
              build a machine learning to predict the survivability of Titanic
              passengers based on dataset given. After consulted with my
              professor, she agreed to let my ground to use the competition on
              Kaggle as a part of my coursework project and asked me present the
              result in class.

              There were three approaches used to build the machine learning to
              predict the survivability of titanic disaster; Random Forest, Deep
              Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. All three approaches gave
              different results and the result improved when the dataset was
              filtered with only important feature of the passanger.

              I was responsible to use the Naive Bayes approach to setup the
              machine learning. I used Python to wrote the machine learning code
              with the help of Scikit Learn tools to implement Naive Bayes
              approach. I also filtered the dataset with only important feature
              of the passenger based on my research of the titanic disaster. For
              example, there was a rumour that during the tragedy, women and
              children were prioritzed to board the emergency boat, thus I
              filtered the dataset with Sex and Ages to get higher accuracy in
              predicting whether a passenger will surive or not.
